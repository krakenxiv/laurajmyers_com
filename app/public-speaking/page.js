          The number two fear in the western world is death. The number one fear
          is public speaking. So it would seem that most people would rather die
          than speak in front of a group of people. I can help you build the
          self-confidence to become a better, more effective public speaker.
          Learn how to engage your audience and entertain as well as inform.
