          My name is Laura Myers and I help people vocalize. Since 2003, I have
          been providing students with private vocal lessons; first in Los
          Angeles, CA and now in Portland, Oregon. I bring over 25 years of
          performance experience on stage, television and film to our lessons.
        </p>
        <p>
          Providing a safe and supportive learning environment for the nervous
          beginner to the seasoned professional singer has always been an
          important part of my philosophy. The more you feel at ease, the more
          you will learn.
        </p>
        <p>
          During the course of our sessions I diagnose and transform your
          singing challenges into healthy, beautiful vocal production. Each
          student possesses different strengths and weaknesses so my lessons are
          tailored to fit your individual needs.

          <strong>Beginners:</strong>
          <br />
          Do you suffer from stage fright? Together we can find the causes of
          your fears and how to move past them.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>Intermediate to advanced singers:</strong>
          <br />
          Are you experiencing difficulties with breath management or
          transitioning to different registers of the voice? I can help.
        </p>
        <p>Write to me or call today with your vocal goals and concerns.</p>
        <p>
          It is normal to feel unsure about taking that first step toward
          something new. Don&apos;t let that stop you from exploring your voice
          and expanding your world. I&apos;m ready if you are!
        </p>
        <p>Rock, pop, jazz, and country and classical are all welcome.</p>
        <p>
          <strong>Audition preparation:</strong>

          services are available at my studio as well. Come in and prepare for
          that audition! If your goal is American Idol or Americas Got Talent,
